This was a class project from CS 120: Advanced Programming

The only contributor to his project is Aidan Siegel. This project does not require any extra installations. The operating system is MAC OS Catalina (this is why the viewport height and width is multiplied by 2). I used some code from my graphics open ended project for the physics of the balls.
This program is very straight forward. The user is given 3 color options after running the program, red, blue, and green. When the user clicks on one of the colors, they are taken to a screen when there is a ball, in the same color of which they picked, bouncing around. The user can press UP on the keyboard to increase the ball size, DOWN on the keyboard to decrease the ball size, LEFT on the keyboard to push the ball left, and RIGHT on the keyboard to push the ball right. After the user is done playing with the ball, they can press "b" on the keyboard which will bring them back to the color option screen where they can choose a new color ball to play with.
I used Is-A relationships and polymorphism from module 2 where the Button Is-A Quad. I used graphics from module 4 to create the interactive screen and the balls bouncing around.
